Data packages for the research project "Participation of serotonin on zebrafish aggression". Data is produced by members from Laboratório de Neurociências e Comportamento "Frederico Guilherme Graeff", affiliated to Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Pará and Universidade do Estado do Pará. The package includes primary data for a behavioral experiment on the effects of acute fluoxetine on zebrafish aggressive display between skin phenotypes (leopard vs. longfin), as well scripts for statistical analysis of these data. The preprint that was submitted to bioRxiv is also included here, for the sake of completion.
